# HRP Portfolio Optimisation

A Python-based implementation of the Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) algorithm for portfolio optimisation.

## Overview

Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) is an advanced portfolio optimisation technique that addresses some of the limitations of traditional methods like Mean-Variance Optimisation. HRP leverages hierarchical clustering to allocate portfolio weights, aiming to create a more robust and diversified portfolio.

## Features

- **Data Fetching**: Retrieves historical stock data using Yahoo Finance.
- **HRP Algorithm**: Implements the HRP algorithm for portfolio weight optimisation using the [PyPortfolioOpt](https://pypi.org/project/PyPortfolioOpt/) library.
- **Portfolio Metrics**: Calculates expected annual return and portfolio volatility.
- **Capital Allocation**: Allocates initial capital based on the latest stock prices.
- **User Interaction**: Interactive prompts for inputting stock tickers, date ranges, and initial capital.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7 or higher**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
